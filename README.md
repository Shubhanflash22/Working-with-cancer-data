# Working with Cancer Data

This project focuses on building an accurate cancer diagnosis model using classical machine learning techniques on a dataset containing 30 feature variables collected from various patients.

## Overview

The workflow includes data aggregation, preprocessing, exploratory analysis, baseline modeling, and progressive model improvement through multiple algorithms and hyperparameter tuning.

## Steps Performed

* **Aggregated** a large dataset of cancer patient records with 30 feature variables.
* **Preprocessed and cleaned** the data to handle inconsistencies and prepare it for modeling.
* Conducted **basic exploratory analysis** to understand feature behavior and correlations.
* Built a **baseline logistic regression model** to establish initial performance.
* Improved performance using:

  * Decision Tree Classifier
  * Naive Bayes Classifiers
  * Support Vector Machine (SVM)
* Identified **SVM as the most accurate model**, then performed **hyperparameter tuning** to further optimize performance.
* **Achieved over 99% accuracy**, demonstrating the effectiveness of the optimized SVM model for this classification task.

## Result

A highly accurate cancer prediction model with >99% accuracy, supported by systematic analysis, model comparison, and optimization.
